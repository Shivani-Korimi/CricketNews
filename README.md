# Personal Mobile App Project Final
Given below is the bare minimum code for a React Native app, which is the essence of what this code is all about.Let's break it down:
##Import Statements

- React: The one runs it over React library which is required to make React components.

- StyleSheet, Text, View: These are the elements rendered and processed through code while the management and styles are executed by react Native.
##App Component
- We begin the App component as a functional component with the arrow function expression syntax.
- Within the App component, as a single View component is displayed, which is the basis for the element of other components.
- The View component is already declared with a style attribute, which is set up using styles.container, which simply defines background color of the container.
##StyleSheet
- With the StyleSheet.create() method, you define styles, using which the individual component can be given different appearances. Here, it introduces a style object called styles with a property of container which includes the value of the background color of the container.
##HomeScreen Component:
- The HomeScreen component is imported from HomeScreen.js file and is positioned inside View component. This means that there is an android.support.v17.gridsample architecture referenced in the screens directory of the project.
Often, this code is primarily responsible for the app entrance (App component) point, as well as rendering the HomeScreen component inside it. The styles const}-{ the styling of the main container.
